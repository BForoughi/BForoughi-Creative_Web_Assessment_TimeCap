# README for creative web assessment two
## TimeCap

### Proposal
- My proposed web app is a social media app called TimeCap. This will be a time capsule app where users can create albums of trips or events, etc... and take photos or videos and lock them within this album for a set period of time, for example: a year. Once that time is up, the album gets unlocked, and the user can reminisce about their previous trip.
- I want the app to output the media as a Polaroid to add to the UX and give it a more dated look.
- I think the app should allow an initial look at the media for security reasons, as well as allow the user to delete/re-take, but once they are happy and have submitted the media, not be able to access the media until the set time is up.
- I want this to be an app that allows the user to visualise and reminisce on their memories of the past. Maybe it's been a couple of years, and they're about to go on another trip, and a locked drip gets unlocked, and they get to experience their previous trip again, all in one location and using a Polaroid format to boost the nostalgia factor.
